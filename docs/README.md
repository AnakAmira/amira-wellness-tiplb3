# Amira Wellness Documentation

Welcome to the Amira Wellness documentation. This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Amira Wellness application, a mobile platform designed to support emotional well-being through accessible self-regulation tools, emotional release mechanisms, and personal growth tracking.

This documentation is intended for developers, system administrators, and other technical stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of the Amira Wellness application.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following main sections:

- **Architecture**: System design, components, and technical decisions
- **API**: API specifications and usage guidelines
- **Development**: Setup guides, coding standards, and workflows
- **Deployment**: Deployment procedures for all components
- **Security**: Security architecture and implementation details

Each section contains detailed documentation relevant to specific aspects of the Amira Wellness application.

## Architecture Documentation

The architecture documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the system design, components, and technical decisions.

- [Overview](architecture/overview.md): High-level architectural overview
- [Backend Architecture](architecture/backend.md): Detailed backend design
- [Mobile Architecture](architecture/mobile.md): iOS and Android application architecture
- [Security Architecture](architecture/security.md): Security implementation details

The architecture documentation is essential for understanding the overall system design and how different components interact with each other.

## API Documentation

The API documentation provides detailed specifications for all API endpoints used by the mobile applications to communicate with the backend services.

- [Authentication](api/authentication.md): User authentication and authorization
- [Journaling](api/journaling.md): Voice journaling functionality
- [Emotions](api/emotions.md): Emotional check-in and tracking
- [Tools](api/tools.md): Tool library and recommendations
- [Progress](api/progress.md): Progress tracking and insights

The API documentation follows OpenAPI 3.0 standards and includes request/response examples, authentication requirements, and error handling details.

## Development Documentation

The development documentation provides guidelines and instructions for setting up development environments and contributing to the project.

- [Setup](development/setup.md): Development environment setup
- [Coding Standards](development/coding-standards.md): Code style and best practices
- [Testing](development/testing.md): Testing strategies and guidelines
- [PR Process](development/pr-process.md): Pull request workflow

These guides ensure consistent development practices across the team and help new developers get started quickly.

## Deployment Documentation

The deployment documentation provides detailed instructions for deploying the application to various environments.

- [Backend Deployment](deployment/backend-deployment.md): Backend services deployment
- [iOS Deployment](deployment/ios-deployment.md): iOS application deployment
- [Android Deployment](deployment/android-deployment.md): Android application deployment

These guides cover infrastructure setup, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and environment configuration.

## Security Documentation

The security documentation provides detailed information about the security architecture and implementation.

- [Encryption](security/encryption.md): End-to-end encryption implementation
- [Data Handling](security/data-handling.md): Secure data handling practices
- [Incident Response](security/incident-response.md): Security incident response procedures

These documents are essential for understanding the security measures implemented to protect user data and ensure privacy.
