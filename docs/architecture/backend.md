## Introduction
This document provides a detailed description of the backend architecture for the Amira Wellness application. The backend is designed as a microservices-based system that supports the core functionality of emotional well-being through accessible self-regulation tools, emotional release mechanisms, and personal growth tracking.

The backend architecture follows these key principles:

- **Microservices Design**: Domain-driven service boundaries with independent deployment and scaling
- **API-First Approach**: Well-defined RESTful APIs for all functionality
- **Security by Design**: End-to-end encryption and comprehensive security controls
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities for all services
- **Resilience**: Fault tolerance with graceful degradation

This document focuses specifically on the server-side components of the Amira Wellness platform, their interactions, and implementation details.

## Service Architecture
The Amira Wellness backend is composed of several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain of functionality. This approach enables independent development, deployment, and scaling of components based on their specific requirements.

## API Design

The Amira Wellness backend follows an API-first design approach with well-defined RESTful APIs for all functionality. This enables clear contracts between services and clients, facilitating independent development and evolution.

### API Gateway

All client requests are routed through an API Gateway that provides:

- Request routing to appropriate backend services
- Authentication and authorization verification
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- CORS handling
- Basic request logging

The API Gateway is implemented using AWS API Gateway with custom authorizers for authentication and authorization.

### API Versioning

APIs are versioned using URL-based versioning to ensure backward compatibility:

```
https://api.amirawellness.com/v1/journals
https://api.amirawellness.com/v2/journals
```

This approach allows for the evolution of APIs while maintaining support for existing clients. The versioning strategy includes:

- Non-breaking changes within versions
- Breaking changes require a new version
- Deprecation notices provided 3 months before end-of-life
- Multiple versions supported simultaneously during transition periods

### Authentication and Authorization

API endpoints are secured using JWT-based authentication with the following characteristics:

- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation for secure session management
- Role-based access control for authorization
- Scope-based permissions for fine-grained access control

## Security Implementation

Security is a fundamental aspect of the Amira Wellness backend architecture, with particular emphasis on protecting sensitive emotional data and voice recordings.

### Authentication Implementation

The authentication system is implemented using JWT-based tokens with the following characteristics:

- Access tokens with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh tokens with 14-day expiration and rotation on use
- Argon2id password hashing with appropriate work factors
- Email verification for new accounts
- Secure password reset workflow
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

The implementation uses FastAPI's security dependencies and integrates with Amazon Cognito for identity management. For more details, see the Authentication Framework section in the Security Architecture document.

### Authorization Implementation

Authorization is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **API Gateway**: Coarse-grained authorization based on JWT claims
2. **Service Layer**: Fine-grained authorization using role and permission checks
3. **Data Layer**: Row-level security in PostgreSQL for data isolation

The system uses role-based access control with the following roles:

- Standard User: Access to own data and basic features
- Premium User: Access to premium features in addition to standard features
- Content Manager: Ability to manage tool library content
- System Administrator: Full system access with administrative capabilities

### End-to-End Encryption Implementation

The backend supports end-to-end encryption for voice recordings with the following characteristics:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant MobileApp
    participant APIGateway
    participant VoiceJournalService
    participant EncryptionService
    participant S3Storage
    participant Database
    
    User->>MobileApp: Record voice journal
    MobileApp->>MobileApp: Encrypt audio locally
    MobileApp->>APIGateway: Upload encrypted audio
    APIGateway->>VoiceJournalService: Process upload request
    VoiceJournalService->>EncryptionService: Verify encryption
    EncryptionService->>VoiceJournalService: Confirm validity
    VoiceJournalService->>S3Storage: Store encrypted audio
    S3Storage->>VoiceJournalService: Return storage reference
    VoiceJournalService->>Database: Save metadata with reference
    Database->>VoiceJournalService: Confirm storage
    VoiceJournalService->>APIGateway: Return success response
    APIGateway->>MobileApp: Confirm upload complete
    MobileApp->>User: Display confirmation
```

Key aspects of the implementation:

- AES-256-GCM encryption for data confidentiality and integrity
- Client-side encryption where audio is encrypted before transmission
- Encryption keys derived from user credentials, never transmitted to the server
- Unique initialization vectors (IV) for each encryption operation
- Authentication tags for integrity verification
- Secure key storage using platform security features (iOS Keychain, Android KeyStore)

The backend never has access to unencrypted user content or encryption keys, ensuring true end-to-end encryption.

### Data Protection Implementation

Data protection measures include:

- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Server-side encryption for databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Server-side encryption for S3 storage
- Data minimization principles
- Purpose-specific data access
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

For more details, see the Data Protection section in the Security Architecture document.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Scaling Strategy] --> B[Horizontal Scaling]
    A --> C[Vertical Scaling]
    A --> D[Functional Scaling]
    A --> E[Geographic Scaling]
    
    B --> F[API Services]
    B --> G[Background Workers]
    
    C --> H[Database]
    C --> I[Cache]
    
    D --> J[Service-Specific Scaling]
    
    E --> K[Multi-Region Deployment]
```

#### Horizontal Scaling

Stateless services are designed for horizontal scaling:

- API services scale based on request load
- Background workers scale based on queue depth
- Auto-scaling groups with health checks
- Load balancing across instances

#### Vertical Scaling

Stateful components scale vertically for performance:

- Database instances scale up for increased capacity
- Cache instances scale up for memory capacity
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads

#### Functional Scaling

Services scale independently based on specific requirements:

- Voice Journal Service scales based on recording volume
- Emotional Tracking Service scales based on check-in frequency
- Tool Library Service scales based on content access patterns

#### Geographic Scaling (Future)

Multi-region deployment for global distribution:

- Region-specific deployments for data residency
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- Content distribution via CDN

### Performance Optimization

Performance is optimized through several techniques:

#### Caching Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Caching Strategy] --> B[API Response Cache]
    A --> C[Content Cache]
    A --> D[Database Query Cache]
    A --> E[Computed Results Cache]
    
    B --> F[Redis]
    C --> G[CloudFront CDN]
    D --> H[PostgreSQL Query Cache]
    E --> I[Redis]
    
    F --> J[Short TTL]
    G --> K[Long TTL]
    H --> L[Automatic Invalidation]
    I --> M[Scheduled Refresh]
```

The system implements a multi-level caching strategy:

- **API Response Caching**: Redis cache for frequent API responses
- **Content Caching**: CDN for static content delivery
- **Database Query Caching**: Result caching for expensive queries
- **Computed Results Caching**: Caching for expensive computations

#### Database Optimization

Database performance is optimized through:

- Proper indexing for common query patterns
- Query optimization and monitoring
- Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Data partitioning for large tables (e.g., emotional check-ins)

#### Asynchronous Processing

Non-critical operations are processed asynchronously:

- Background workers for data processing
- Message queues for task distribution
- Scheduled tasks for periodic operations
- Event-driven architecture for decoupling

#### Efficient API Design

API design optimizations include:

- Pagination for large result sets

- GraphQL (future) for flexible data fetching

## Resilience and Fault Tolerance

The Amira Wellness backend implements resilience patterns to ensure system availability and data integrity even during component failures.

### High Availability Design

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Region 1"
        subgraph "AZ 1"
            A[API Services]
            B[Database Primary]
        end
        
        subgraph "AZ 2"
            C[API Services]
            D[Database Standby]
        end
        
        E[Load Balancer]
        F[S3 Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region 2"
        G[Disaster Recovery]
        H[S3 Replica]
    end
    
    E --> A
    E --> C
    B <--> D
    B --> G
    F <--> H
```

High availability is achieved through:

- Multi-AZ deployment for redundancy
- Auto-scaling groups for service instances
- Database replication with automated failover
- Stateless service design for easy replacement
- Load balancing across healthy instances

### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The system implements circuit breakers for dependency failures:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout period elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success threshold met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failures continue
```

Circuit breakers are implemented for:

- Service-to-service communication
- Database connections
- External service integrations
- Storage operations

#### Retry Mechanisms

Retry strategies are implemented for transient failures:

- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Maximum retry limits
- Retry budgets to prevent cascading failures
- Idempotent operations for safe retries

#### Fallback Responses

Fallback mechanisms for degraded operation:

- Cached responses when live data is unavailable
- Default values for missing data
- Graceful degradation of features
- Clear user communication about limited functionality

#### Bulkhead Pattern

Resource isolation to prevent cascading failures:

- Separate connection pools for different services
- Thread pool isolation for critical operations
- Resource quotas for fair resource allocation
- Timeout policies to prevent resource exhaustion

### Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery capabilities include:

- Regular automated backups
