# Amira Wellness Security Architecture

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security architecture for the Amira Wellness application. Security is a fundamental aspect of the application design, with particular emphasis on protecting sensitive emotional data and voice recordings.

The security architecture is built on the following key principles:

- **Privacy by Design**: Security measures are integrated into all aspects of the application architecture from the ground up
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect user data
- **Least Privilege**: Components and users only have access to the resources they need
- **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default and require explicit action to disable
- **Transparency**: Security measures are documented and communicated to users

This document covers authentication and authorization mechanisms, end-to-end encryption implementation, data protection measures, and infrastructure security controls that collectively ensure the privacy and security of user data. The security architecture described here is designed to support the overall system architecture while maintaining the privacy-first approach that is central to Amira Wellness.

## Authentication Framework

The Amira Wellness application implements a comprehensive authentication framework to verify user identity and control access to resources.

### Authentication Mechanisms

The primary authentication mechanism is JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication with the following characteristics:

- Email and password authentication with secure password policies
- JWT tokens signed with RS256 algorithm
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) for API requests
- Refresh tokens with rotation for maintaining sessions
- Future support for social authentication providers

The authentication flow follows these steps:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as Mobile App
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant Service as API Service
    
    User->>Client: Login credentials
    Client->>Gateway: Authentication request
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate credentials
    Auth->>Gateway: Issue JWT tokens (access + refresh)
    Gateway->>Client: Return tokens
    
    Client->>Gateway: API request with access token
    Gateway->>Gateway: Validate token
    Gateway->>Service: Forward authenticated request
    Service->>Gateway: Response
    Gateway->>Client: Return response
    
    Note over Client,Auth: When access token expires
    Client->>Gateway: Request with expired token
    Gateway->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
    Client->>Gateway: Request new token with refresh token
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate refresh token
    Auth->>Gateway: Issue new access token
    Gateway->>Client: Return new access token
```

This approach provides secure authentication while maintaining a good user experience by not requiring frequent re-authentication.

### Password Security

Password security is enforced through the following measures:

- Minimum length of 10 characters
- Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Check against common password lists
- Argon2id password hashing with appropriate work factors
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts with progressive delays

Password validation is performed both client-side for immediate feedback and server-side for enforcement. Password hashes are never exposed outside the authentication service.

### Token Management

The token management system implements the following security features:

- Access tokens are short-lived (15 minutes) to limit the impact of token theft
- Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan (14 days) but are rotated on each use
- Tokens are stored securely on mobile devices using platform security features (iOS Keychain, Android KeyStore)
- Tokens can be revoked server-side in case of security incidents
- All tokens include standard JWT claims (iss, sub, exp, iat, jti) for validation

Token validation occurs at multiple levels:
1. API Gateway validates token signature and expiration
2. Services validate token claims and permissions
3. Client validates token expiration before use

### Multi-Factor Authentication

The authentication framework includes support for multi-factor authentication (MFA):

- Initial implementation includes email verification as a second factor
- Future support for authenticator apps (TOTP) is planned
- MFA will be required for sensitive operations like data export
- Risk-based MFA triggers (new device, unusual location) will be implemented

The MFA implementation follows NIST guidelines for secure authentication.

## Authorization System

The authorization system controls what authenticated users can access and what actions they can perform.

### Role-Based Access Control

The application implements role-based access control (RBAC) with the following roles:

- **User**: Standard application user with access to their own data
- **Premium User**: User with access to premium features (future)
- **Content Manager**: Administrator for tool library content
- **System Administrator**: Full system access for maintenance and support

Each role has specific permissions that determine what resources they can access and what operations they can perform. Permissions are enforced at multiple levels:

1. API Gateway for coarse-grained access control
2. Service layer for fine-grained permission checks
3. Database level for row-level security

This multi-layered approach ensures that authorization cannot be bypassed by targeting a specific component.

### Resource Authorization

Resource authorization follows these principles:

- Users can only access their own data by default
- Resource ownership is verified for all operations
- Explicit sharing mechanisms are required for any data sharing
- Content managers can only access non-personal content
- System administrators have access to system configuration but not user content

Resource authorization is implemented through:

1. User ID verification in API requests
2. Database queries filtered by user ID
3. Object-level permission checks before operations
4. Audit logging of all access attempts

### API Authorization

API endpoints are protected through:

- Required authentication for all non-public endpoints
- Permission checks based on user role and resource ownership
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent unauthorized operations

API authorization is centralized in the API Gateway and consistently applied across all services.

## End-to-End Encryption

End-to-end encryption is a core security feature of the Amira Wellness application, ensuring that sensitive user data, particularly voice recordings, can only be accessed by the user who created it.

### Encryption Architecture

The encryption architecture follows these key principles:

- Client-side encryption for all sensitive data
- User-controlled encryption keys derived from passwords
- Server never has access to unencrypted data or encryption keys
- Modern, widely-reviewed encryption algorithms

The encryption system uses a hierarchical key model:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Password] --> B[Key Derivation Function]
    B --> C[Master Key]
    C --> D[Journal Encryption Keys]
    C --> E[Emotional Data Keys]
    C --> F[Export Keys]
    
    G[Platform Security] --> H[Secure Storage]
    H --> C
    
    D --> I[Encrypted Journals]
    E --> J[Encrypted Emotional Data]
    F --> K[Encrypted Exports]
```

This approach ensures that each data type has its own encryption keys, limiting the impact of any potential key compromise.

### Encryption Standards

The application uses the following encryption standards:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id with appropriate memory, iterations, and parallelism parameters
- **Random Number Generation**: Platform-specific secure random number generators
- **Key Length**: 256 bits for all encryption keys
- **Initialization Vectors**: Unique for each encryption operation
- **Authentication Tags**: Used to verify data integrity
- **Forward Secrecy**: Implemented for communications

These standards were selected based on current cryptographic best practices and recommendations from NIST and other security organizations. Regular reviews of cryptographic standards ensure that the encryption remains strong against evolving threats.

### Key Management

Encryption keys are managed securely through:

- **Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generators
- **Key Storage**: Hardware-backed secure storage where available (iOS Secure Enclave, Android KeyStore)
- **Key Protection**: Master keys are encrypted with keys derived from user passwords
- **Key Derivation**: Password-based keys use Argon2id with salt and appropriate work factors
- **Key Rotation**: Support for key rotation when passwords change
- **Key Backup**: Optional encrypted key backup mechanisms
- **Key Isolation**: Keys are memory-protected during use and never persisted in plaintext

The key management system ensures that keys are protected at rest and during use, with hardware protection where available. Additional measures include secure key destruction when no longer needed and defense against side-channel attacks.

### Implementation Details

The end-to-end encryption is implemented across all platforms:

- **iOS**: Uses CryptoKit for encryption operations and Keychain for secure key storage
- **Android**: Uses Java Cryptography Architecture with Android KeyStore for secure key storage
- **Backend**: Uses Python cryptography library for handling encrypted data without decryption

Each platform implementation follows the same encryption standards and protocols while leveraging platform-specific security features for maximum protection. Implementation details include:

- Secure memory handling for cryptographic operations
- Protection against timing attacks
- Validation of encryption parameters
- Comprehensive testing of cryptographic implementations
- Regular security audits of encryption code

### Encryption Workflow

The encryption workflow for voice journals follows these steps:

1. User records a voice journal on their device
2. Client generates or retrieves the encryption key for the journal
3. Client generates a unique initialization vector (IV)
4. Client encrypts the audio data with AES-256-GCM using the key and IV
5. Client generates and verifies the authentication tag
6. Client uploads the encrypted data, IV, and authentication tag to the server
7. Server stores the encrypted data without decryption capability
8. When the user wants to play the recording, the client downloads the encrypted data
9. Client verifies the authentication tag to ensure data integrity
10. Client decrypts the data using the stored encryption key and the IV
11. Client plays the decrypted audio

This workflow ensures that the server never has access to the unencrypted data or the encryption keys, providing true end-to-end encryption. Similar workflows are implemented for other sensitive data types such as emotional check-in information.

### Cryptographic Validation

The encryption implementation undergoes rigorous validation:

- Compliance with FIPS 140-2 requirements where applicable
- Regular cryptographic algorithm review
- Validation against known cryptographic attack vectors
