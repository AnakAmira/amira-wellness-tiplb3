# End-to-End Encryption in Amira Wellness

## Introduction

This document details the end-to-end encryption implementation in the Amira Wellness application. Encryption is a cornerstone of our privacy-first design philosophy, ensuring that sensitive user data, particularly voice recordings and emotional check-ins, remains private and secure throughout its lifecycle.

Amira Wellness handles highly personal and sensitive information that reveals users' emotional states and innermost thoughts. Our encryption architecture guarantees that this data can only be accessed by the user who created it, protecting it from external threats, server breaches, and even from our own staff. 

This comprehensive encryption implementation addresses the following key objectives:
- Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of voice journal recordings
- Securing sensitive emotional check-in data
- Ensuring user control over personal data
- Meeting regulatory requirements for privacy and data protection
- Building user trust through transparent security measures

## Encryption Architecture

### End-to-End Encryption Model

The end-to-end encryption model in Amira Wellness follows these core principles:

1. **Client-side encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted on the user's device before transmission
2. **User-controlled keys**: Encryption keys are derived from user credentials and never leave the device
3. **Zero-knowledge design**: Server infrastructure never has access to unencrypted data or encryption keys
4. **Complete privacy**: Even Amira Wellness staff cannot access users' sensitive content

This model protects user data against various threats including server breaches, network interception, and unauthorized internal access.

        J --> N[Decrypted Data]
        N --> O[User Access]
    end
```

### Client-Side Encryption

Client-side encryption is implemented on both iOS and Android platforms:

1. **Data Processing Flow**:
   - Data is captured in memory (voice recording, emotional check-in)
   - An encryption key is derived from the user's credentials
   - A unique initialization vector is generated for each encryption operation
   - Data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM before leaving the secure memory space
   - Encrypted data is prepared for storage or transmission

2. **Security Boundaries**:
   - The device's secure memory is the only place where unencrypted data exists
   - Encryption occurs before data is written to disk or transmitted
   - Keys are protected using platform security features (iOS Keychain, Android KeyStore)
   - Optional additional protection through biometric authentication

3. **Platform Security Integration**:
   - iOS: Secure Enclave for biometric-protected keys on supported devices
   - Android: Hardware-backed KeyStore for secure key storage where available
   - Memory protection to prevent unauthorized access during processing

### Server-Side Security

While the server never has access to unencrypted data or encryption keys, it implements several additional security measures:

1. **Transport Security**:
   - TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites for all API communications
   - Certificate pinning in mobile applications
   - Protection against downgrade attacks

2. **Storage Security**:
   - Encrypted data stored in secure cloud infrastructure (AWS S3)
   - Server-side encryption at rest (in addition to client-side encryption)
   - Strict access controls and audit logging

3. **Request Validation**:
   - Authentication and authorization for all data access
   - Request signing to prevent tampering
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

4. **Integrity Verification**:
   - Authentication tags stored with encrypted data
   - Server-side integrity checks before storage and after retrieval
   - Tamper detection mechanisms

### Encryption Boundaries

The encryption system has clearly defined boundaries that determine what data is encrypted and at what points:

1. **Data Classification**:
   - **Highly Sensitive** (End-to-End Encrypted): Voice recordings, emotional check-in data
   - **Sensitive** (Encrypted at Rest): User profile information, app settings
   - **Non-Sensitive** (Standard Protection): Public content, anonymized analytics

2. **Trust Boundaries**:
   - **Trusted**: User's authenticated device with proper key access
   - **Semi-Trusted**: Server infrastructure with encrypted data access
   - **Untrusted**: Public networks, third-party systems

3. **Encryption Points**:
   - Before storage (local or remote)
   - Before transmission (even over TLS)
   - During backup/export operations

## Encryption Algorithms and Standards

### AES-256-GCM

Amira Wellness uses AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode) as the primary encryption algorithm:

**Specifications:**
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Length**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **IV Length**: 96 bits (12 bytes)
- **Authentication Tag Length**: 128 bits (16 bytes)

**Implementation Details:**
- Unique initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation
- Associated authenticated data (AAD) includes metadata for integrity protection
- Authentication tags stored with encrypted data for integrity verification
- Fully conformant with NIST SP 800-38D specifications

**Security Properties:**
- Confidentiality protection of encrypted data
- Integrity verification to detect tampering
- Authentication to confirm data source
- Resistance against known cryptographic attacks

AES-256-GCM was selected for its combination of security, performance, and widespread support across platforms. Its authenticated encryption capability provides both confidentiality and integrity in a single operation, simplifying the security architecture while maintaining strong protection.

### Key Derivation Functions

Secure key derivation is crucial for generating strong encryption keys from user passwords:

**Primary: Argon2id**
- **Purpose**: Password-based key derivation
- **Parameters**:
  - Memory cost: 64 MB
  - Iterations: 3
  - Parallelism: 4
  - Output length: 32 bytes (256 bits)
- **Implementation**: Uses validated libraries on each platform
- **Security Properties**: Memory-hard function resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks

**Alternative: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256**
- **Purpose**: Alternative when Argon2id is not available
- **Parameters**:
  - Iterations: 100,000 (adjusted based on device performance)
  - Salt length: 16 bytes (128 bits)
  - Output length: 32 bytes (256 bits)
- **Implementation**: Native implementation on iOS, BouncyCastle on Android
- **Security Properties**: Widely reviewed key derivation function

Both functions utilize cryptographically secure random salts to prevent rainbow table attacks and ensure that identical passwords produce different encryption keys.

### Transport Layer Security

All communication between the mobile applications and backend services is protected using TLS:

**Specifications:**
- **Protocol Version**: TLS 1.3 (fallback to TLS 1.2 with secure configurations when necessary)
- **Cipher Suites**:
  - `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` (preferred)
  - `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` (alternative)
- **Key Exchange**: ECDHE with P-256 or X25519
- **Certificate Validation**: Full validation with certificate pinning

**Additional Transport Security Measures:**
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Certificate pinning in mobile applications
- Extended validation certificates for production environments
- Regular certificate rotation

TLS provides an additional layer of protection for all data in transit, including already encrypted sensitive data, ensuring protection against network-based attacks.

### Cryptographic Libraries

## Key Management

### Key Hierarchy

Amira Wellness implements a hierarchical key management system:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Password] --> B[Key Derivation Function]
    B --> C[Master Key]
    C --> D[Journal Encryption Keys]
    C --> E[Emotional Data Keys]
    C --> F[Export Keys]
    
    G[Platform Security] --> H[Secure Storage]
    H --> C
    
    D --> I[Encrypted Journals]
    E --> J[Encrypted Emotional Data]
    F --> K[Encrypted Exports]
```

1. **User Master Key (UMK)**:
   - Primary encryption key derived from user password
   - Used to protect all other keys in the hierarchy
   - Never stored in plaintext, only in protected form
   - Rotation occurs on password change

2. **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**:
   - Purpose-specific keys for different data types
   - Encrypted with the UMK before storage
   - Unique per data category (journals, emotional data)
   - Regular rotation without requiring password change

3. **Media Encryption Keys (MEKs)**:
   - Individual keys for specific voice recordings
   - Encrypted with the Journal DEK
   - Unique per recording for isolation
   - Stored with the encrypted recording

4. **Authentication Keys**:
   - Used for message authentication
   - Derived separately from encryption keys
   - Applied to verify data integrity
   - Rotation aligned with encryption keys

This hierarchical model enables key isolation, efficient key rotation, and compartmentalization of security breaches.

### Key Generation

Secure key generation is fundamental to the encryption system:

1. **Random Number Generation**:
   - **iOS**: `SecRandomCopyBytes` for cryptographically secure random data
   - **Android**: `SecureRandom` with the strongest available provider
   - **Backend**: `secrets.token_bytes` or equivalent

2. **Key Generation Process**:
   - 256-bit (32-byte) randomly generated keys for symmetric encryption
   - Full-entropy generation using cryptographically secure random number generators
   - Hardware-based entropy sources when available
   - Post-generation validation to verify key quality

3. **Initialization Vector (IV) Generation**:
   - 96-bit (12-byte) randomly generated IVs for each encryption operation
   - Never reused across encryption operations
   - Generated immediately before encryption
   - Stored alongside encrypted data for decryption

All generated keys undergo validation to ensure they meet cryptographic strength requirements before use.

### Key Storage

Encryption keys are stored securely using platform-specific security features:

**iOS Key Storage:**
- **Keychain Services**: Used with appropriate protection classes
  - `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` for most keys
  - Additional biometric protection when available
- **Secure Enclave**: For biometric-protected keys on supported devices
- **Encrypted Key Blobs**: Keys are encrypted before storage in Keychain

**Android Key Storage:**
- **Android Keystore System**: Hardware-backed key storage where available
- **StrongBox Keymaster**: On supported devices for hardware isolation
- **EncryptedSharedPreferences**: For encrypted storage of key material
- **User authentication binding**: Optional authentication requirement for key access

**Key Metadata Protection:**
- Metadata stored separately from key material
- Minimal metadata to reduce exposure
- Integrity protection for key metadata
- Access controls on metadata equivalent to key material

Keys are never exposed in plaintext outside of secure memory during cryptographic operations, and secure deletion is implemented when keys are no longer needed.

### Key Rotation

The key management system implements key rotation to limit the impact of potential key compromise:

1. **User Master Key Rotation**:
   - Triggered by password changes
   - Previous master key decrypts DEKs
   - New master key re-encrypts DEKs
   - Secure deletion of previous master key

2. **Data Encryption Key Rotation**:
   - Periodic rotation based on security policy (default: 90 days)
   - New data encrypted with new keys
   - Historical data remains accessible with old keys
   - Optional background re-encryption of historical data

3. **Automatic Rotation Triggers**:
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Device change or new login
   - Operating system upgrade
   - Application security updates

4. **Key Rotation Process**:
   - Generate new key
   - Encrypt with appropriate parent key
   - Update key metadata and version
   - Maintain secure access to previous keys for decryption
   - Gradually phase out old keys

Key rotation maintains the security of the encryption system over time and limits the amount of data protected by any single key.

### Password-Based Key Derivation

The User Master Key is derived from the user's password using secure key derivation:

1. **Key Derivation Process**:
   - Generate a cryptographically secure random salt (16 bytes)
   - Apply Argon2id with memory-hard parameters
   - Produce a 256-bit key for AES-256-GCM

2. **Salt Management**:
   - Unique salt for each user
   - Stored alongside encrypted master key
   - Rotated during password changes
   - Protected with same controls as key material

3. **Strengthening Measures**:
   - Strong password requirements enforced during creation
   - Password strength estimation and feedback
   - Rate limiting on derivation attempts
   - Progressive delays for repeated attempts

4. **Memory Protection**:
   - Key material zeroed in memory after use
   - Protection against memory dumps
   - Secure allocation for cryptographic operations
   - Minimized key material lifetime in memory

Password-based key derivation transforms user passwords into cryptographically strong keys while making brute force attacks computationally expensive.

   - Fallback mechanism for devices without biometric capabilities

2. **Android Implementation**:
   - BiometricPrompt API for authentication
   - Keystore with `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`
   - Strong authentication requirements
   - Device credential fallback

3. **User Experience**:
   - Optional feature (enabled by user choice)
   - Graceful fallback to password authentication
   - Clear explanation of security benefits
   - Support for all platform-supported biometric types

4. **Security Model**:
   - Biometrics protect access to encryption keys
   - Keys remain encrypted at rest
   - Biometric data never leaves the device
   - Authentication failures limit before fallback

Biometric protection adds an additional layer of security by requiring physical presence and biometric verification before encrypted data can be accessed.
