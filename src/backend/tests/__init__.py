# This file intentionally left mostly empty to mark the tests directory
# as a Python package. This allows test discovery tools to find and
# execute the tests in this directory and its subdirectories.
#
# Common test fixtures and utilities should be placed in conftest.py
# or dedicated utility modules within the tests package.
