## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### System Overview

Amira Wellness employs a client-server architecture with native mobile applications communicating with cloud-based backend services. The system follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data layers.

Key architectural principles include:
- **Privacy by design**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive user data, particularly voice recordings
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable microservices to accommodate user growth
- **Resilience**: Fault-tolerant design with graceful degradation capabilities
- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled components to enable independent development and deployment

The system boundaries encompass mobile client applications (iOS and Android), backend API services, secure cloud storage, and third-party integration points for authentication and notifications. Major interfaces include RESTful APIs for client-server communication, secure storage interfaces for encrypted data, and notification delivery channels.

#### Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Mobile Client | User interface, audio recording, local caching | Device OS, network connectivity | Offline capabilities, battery usage, secure local storage |
| Authentication Service | User identity management, access control | Identity provider, encryption service | Token security, session management, privacy compliance |
| API Gateway | Request routing, rate limiting, API versioning | Service registry, load balancer | Performance, security, request validation |
| Voice Journal Service | Audio processing, storage management | Encryption service, cloud storage | Audio quality, storage efficiency, privacy |
| Emotional Tracking Service | Emotion data processing, pattern analysis | Analytics engine, recommendation service | Data accuracy, pattern recognition algorithms |
| Tool Library Service | Content management, tool recommendations | Content database, user preferences | Content relevance, personalization accuracy |
| Progress Tracking Service | User activity analysis, streak management | Analytics engine, notification service | Data aggregation, insight generation |
| Notification Service | Alert delivery, reminder management | Push notification providers, user preferences | Timing accuracy, delivery reliability |

#### Data Flow Description

The primary data flow begins with user interactions in the mobile client, which are processed locally before being securely transmitted to backend services through the API Gateway. Authentication tokens accompany all requests to verify user identity and permissions.

Voice journaling data follows a specialized flow where audio is recorded locally, encrypted on-device, and then transmitted to the Voice Journal Service. This service manages secure storage in the cloud while maintaining metadata references in the database. Emotional check-in data is captured before and after journaling sessions, flowing to the Emotional Tracking Service for storage and analysis.

The Tool Library Service provides content to users based on their emotional state and preferences, with usage data flowing back to inform the recommendation engine. The Progress Tracking Service aggregates data from multiple services to generate insights and trigger notifications through the Notification Service.

Key data stores include the encrypted audio storage for voice journals, the user profile database, the emotional data time-series database, and the content management system for the tool library. Caching occurs at multiple levels, including client-side caching for frequently accessed tools and server-side caching for recommendation algorithms.

#### External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| AWS Cognito | Authentication | Request-response | OAuth 2.0/HTTPS | 99.9% availability, <500ms response time |
| AWS S3 | Storage | Asynchronous upload/download | HTTPS/REST | 99.99% availability, <1s upload initiation |
| Firebase FCM | Notifications | Publish-subscribe | HTTPS/JSON | 99% delivery rate, <5s delivery time |
| AWS CloudFront | Content delivery | Cache-based distribution | HTTPS | 99.9% availability, <200ms response time |
| AWS KMS | Encryption | Request-response | HTTPS/REST | 99.999% availability, <300ms response time |

### TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Overall Architecture | Microservices | Monolithic, Serverless | Enables independent scaling of components, supports team autonomy, and provides flexibility for future expansion |
| Client Architecture | Native Mobile Apps | Progressive Web App, Hybrid | Provides best performance for audio recording, access to native security features, and optimal user experience |
| API Design | RESTful with JSON | GraphQL, gRPC | Simplifies integration, widely supported by tools and libraries, and familiar to development team |
| Data Storage | Polyglot Persistence | Single Database System | Different data types (audio, time-series emotional data, content) have different storage requirements |

The microservices architecture was selected to allow independent scaling of high-demand components like voice journaling while maintaining isolation for sensitive services like authentication. Native mobile applications provide the performance and security capabilities essential for audio recording and local encryption, which would be limited in web-based alternatives.

#### Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Application | Benefits | Considerations |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Synchronous REST | User interactions, real-time features | Immediate feedback, simple implementation | Requires reliable network connectivity |
| Asynchronous Messaging | Audio uploads, notifications | Resilience to network issues, background processing | Complexity in tracking status, eventual consistency |
| Publish-Subscribe | Notifications, achievement events | Decoupled components, scalable event distribution | Message delivery guarantees, ordering challenges |
| Batch Processing | Analytics, insight generation | Efficient resource usage, comprehensive processing | Delayed results, scheduling complexity |

The system employs synchronous REST communication for most user-facing interactions to provide immediate feedback. Asynchronous messaging is used for audio uploads to handle potential network interruptions and large file sizes. The publish-subscribe pattern supports notification delivery and system events, while batch processing handles computationally intensive analytics operations.

#### Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Selected Solution | Justification |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| User Profiles | PostgreSQL | Strong consistency, relational integrity for user data |
| Voice Recordings | AWS S3 with client-side encryption | Scalable object storage, cost-effective for large files |
| Emotional Data | TimescaleDB | Optimized for time-series data, efficient querying of temporal patterns |
| Tool Content | MongoDB | Flexible schema for varied content types, document-oriented structure |
| Session Data | Redis | In-memory performance, automatic expiration for temporary data |

The data storage strategy employs specialized solutions for different data types to optimize performance, cost, and security. Voice recordings use encrypted object storage to handle large files efficiently while maintaining privacy. Emotional data leverages time-series capabilities for pattern analysis, and tool content uses document storage for flexibility in content structure.

#### Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Purpose | Invalidation Strategy |
|------------|----------------|---------|------------------------|
| API Response Cache | Redis | Reduce database load, improve response times | Time-based expiration, explicit invalidation on updates |
| Content Cache | CloudFront CDN | Accelerate delivery of static tool content | Version-based cache keys, controlled invalidation |
| User Preference Cache | In-memory (service level) | Reduce latency for personalization | Short TTL, event-based invalidation |
| Computed Insights Cache | Redis | Avoid recalculation of expensive analytics | Time-based expiration, recalculation on new data |

The caching strategy balances performance improvements with data freshness requirements. API responses use short-lived caches to reduce database load while ensuring reasonable data currency. Content caching employs a CDN for global distribution of static assets, while computed insights use longer cache periods with scheduled recalculation to optimize resource usage.

#### Security Mechanism Selection

| Security Concern | Selected Mechanism | Justification |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Authentication | JWT with OAuth 2.0 | Industry standard, supports multiple authentication flows |
| Data Privacy | End-to-end encryption | Ensures data can only be accessed by the user, even if storage is compromised |
| API Security | TLS, API keys, rate limiting | Protects against interception and abuse |
| Storage Security | Encrypted at rest, access controls | Defense in depth for stored data |
| Mobile Security | Secure local storage, certificate pinning | Protects against device-level threats |

Security mechanisms were selected based on the privacy-first requirement of the application. End-to-end encryption ensures that sensitive voice recordings and emotional data remain private even from the application operators. JWT authentication provides secure, stateless authentication while supporting future expansion to additional authentication methods.

### CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### Monitoring and Observability Approach

Amira Wellness implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy to ensure system health, performance, and security. The approach includes:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch metrics for resource utilization, service health, and scaling triggers
- **Application Performance Monitoring**: Custom instrumentation and tracing to identify bottlenecks and optimize user experience
- **Business Metrics**: Tracking of key performance indicators like active users, feature usage, and emotional improvement trends
- **Alerting**: Tiered alerting system with appropriate escalation paths based on severity and impact
- **Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of system health and business metrics for operations and stakeholders

Observability is implemented through distributed tracing with correlation IDs across service boundaries, structured logging with consistent formats, and centralized log aggregation for analysis and troubleshooting.

#### Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Category | Content | Retention | Privacy Considerations |
|--------------|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| System Logs | Service health, resource usage | 30 days | No PII, aggregated metrics |
| Application Logs | Feature usage, error details | 90 days | Anonymized user identifiers |
| Security Logs | Authentication events, access patterns | 1 year | Minimal identifiable information |
| Audit Logs | Data access, administrative actions | 2 years | Compliance-focused, restricted access |

The logging strategy employs structured JSON logging with consistent field names across services. Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) are used appropriately to facilitate filtering and alerting. Distributed tracing with correlation IDs enables end-to-end request tracking across service boundaries.

Privacy is maintained by avoiding logging of sensitive user data, using anonymized identifiers where user context is necessary, and implementing access controls on log storage and analysis tools.

#### Error Handling Patterns

The application implements a layered error handling approach:

1. **Client-Side Handling**: Graceful degradation, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and user-friendly error messages
2. **API Gateway**: Request validation, rate limiting, and consistent error response formatting
3. **Service Layer**: Domain-specific error classification, detailed logging, and appropriate status codes
4. **Infrastructure**: Auto-recovery, circuit breakers, and fallback mechanisms

Error responses follow a consistent structure with error codes, user-friendly messages, and detailed developer information when appropriate. Critical errors trigger alerts for immediate attention, while patterns of errors are analyzed to identify systemic issues.

    UserMessage --> Suggest[Suggest User Action]
    Notify --> Investigate[Investigate Root Cause]
    Block --> Review[Security Review]
```

#### Authentication and Authorization Framework

Amira Wellness implements a comprehensive authentication and authorization framework:

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, supporting email/password and future social login options
- **Token Management**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation for security
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Optional for sensitive operations like data export
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with inactivity timeouts and device tracking

The authorization model defines roles including standard users, premium users, content administrators, and system administrators. Each role has specific permissions mapped to API endpoints and resources, enforced at the API Gateway and service levels.

#### Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| API Response Time | <500ms (p95) | >1s (p95) | Application monitoring |
| Voice Recording Latency | <1s start time | >2s start time | Client-side metrics |
| Emotional Check-in Response | <1s (p99) | >2s (p99) | Application monitoring |
| System Availability | 99.9% uptime | <99.5% uptime | Infrastructure monitoring |
| Data Synchronization | <5min delay | >15min delay | Sync status tracking |

Performance is monitored continuously with automated alerts for threshold violations. Load testing is performed before major releases to ensure scalability, and performance optimization is prioritized for critical user journeys like voice journaling and emotional check-ins.

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

Amira Wellness implements a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy:

- **Data Backup**: Daily automated backups of all databases with point-in-time recovery capability
- **Backup Verification**: Weekly automated restoration tests to verify backup integrity
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours for critical services, 24 hours for non-critical services
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour data loss maximum for critical data, 24 hours for non-critical data
- **Disaster Scenarios**: Documented procedures for infrastructure failure, data corruption, security breach, and regional outage

The disaster recovery plan includes clear roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and step-by-step recovery procedures. Regular disaster recovery drills ensure team readiness and validate recovery processes.

#### Tool Library Implementation

**Tool Content Structure**

The Tool Library implements a flexible content structure to support various tool types:

1. **Text-Based Tools**
   - Journaling prompts
   - Reflection exercises
   - Written instructions

2. **Audio-Based Tools**
   - Guided meditations
   - Breathwork exercises
   - Affirmations

3. **Interactive Tools**
   - Step-by-step exercises
   - Timed activities
   - Input-based tools

Each tool follows a consistent metadata structure:

```
{
  "id": "unique-tool-id",
  "name": "Tool Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the tool",
  "category": {
    "id": "category-id",
    "name": "Category Name"
  },
  "contentType": "TEXT|AUDIO|VIDEO|INTERACTIVE|GUIDED_EXERCISE",
  "targetEmotions": ["ANXIETY", "OVERWHELM"],
  "estimatedDuration": 5, // minutes
  "content": {
    // Content varies based on contentType
    "title": "Tool Title",
    "instructions": "Main instructions",
    "mediaUrl": "url-to-media-if-applicable",
    "steps": [
      {
        "order": 1,
        "title": "Step 1",
        "description": "Step description",
        "duration": 60 // seconds
      },
      // Additional steps
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "author": "Tool author",
    "createdDate": "2023-01-01",
    "version": "1.0",
    "tags": ["beginner", "quick"]
  }
}
```

**Tool Recommendation Algorithm**

The recommendation engine uses a multi-factor scoring system:

1. **Emotional Relevance (40%)**
   - Match between tool's target emotions and user's current emotional state
   - Consideration of emotional intensity

2. **User Preferences (30%)**
   - Previous tool usage patterns
   - Explicitly favorited tools
   - Completed vs. abandoned tools

3. **Contextual Factors (20%)**
   - Time of day
   - Available time (based on tool duration)
   - Current streak status

4. **Diversity (10%)**
   - Ensuring variety in recommendations
   - Introducing new tools periodically

The algorithm calculates a relevance score (0-1) for each tool and returns the top-ranked tools.

**Offline Access Implementation**

To support offline access to tools:

1. **Favorited tools** are automatically downloaded and stored locally
2. **Recently used tools** are cached based on usage patterns
3. **Essential tools** (core set) are included in the app package
4. **Media content** is stored in compressed format to minimize storage
5. **Sync mechanism** updates tool content when online

#### Progress Tracking Implementation

**Streak Calculation Algorithm**

The streak system implements a flexible approach to maintain user motivation:

1. **Daily Activity Definition**
   - Any meaningful interaction (journal, check-in, tool usage)
   - Minimum engagement threshold (e.g., 2-minute interaction)

2. **Grace Period**
   - One missed day doesn't break streak if followed by activity
   - Limited to once per week to maintain integrity

3. **Streak Calculation**
   - Incremented at first qualifying activity each day
   - Timezone-aware to handle travel scenarios
   - Persisted locally and synced to server

4. **Milestone Triggers**
   - Achievement unlocks at specific streak counts (7, 14, 30, etc.)
   - Special celebrations for major milestones

**Emotional Trend Analysis**

The emotional trend analysis implements:

1. **Data Aggregation**
   - Daily emotional averages
   - Weekly emotional patterns
   - Monthly emotional summaries

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Recurring emotional cycles
   - Correlation with days of week
   - Intensity progression over time

3. **Insight Generation**
   - Identifying most frequent emotions
   - Detecting emotional shifts after tool usage
   - Recognizing improvement patterns

4. **Visualization Components**
   - Line charts for emotion intensity over time
   - Heatmaps for emotion frequency
   - Before/after comparisons for journaling sessions

```mermaid

    A[Emotional Data Points] --> B[Data Preprocessing]
    B --> C[Temporal Aggregation]
    C --> D[Pattern Detection]
    
    D --> E[Cycle Detection]

    H --> J[Tool Recommendations]
    H --> K[Progress Indicators]
    
    I --> L[User Presentation Layer]
    J --> L
    K --> L
```

#### Encryption Implementation

**End-to-End Encryption Approach**

The encryption service implements true end-to-end encryption:

1. **Key Generation**
   - Device-generated encryption keys
   - Key derivation from user credentials
   - Secure storage in device keychain/keystore

2. **Encryption Process**
   - AES-256-GCM for data encryption
   - RSA for key exchange when needed
   - Unique IV for each encryption operation
   - Authentication tags for integrity verification

3. **Metadata Handling**
   - Sensitive metadata encrypted
   - Non-sensitive metadata stored separately
   - Searchable encryption for specific fields

4. **Key Management**
   - Biometric protection option for key access
   - Key rotation schedule
   - Secure backup mechanism

**Secure Export Implementation**

For sharing or backing up encrypted data:

1. **Export Package Creation**
   - Password-based encryption for the package
   - Inclusion of necessary decryption information
   - Integrity verification data

2. **Export Format**
   - Standardized format for cross-platform compatibility
   - Version information for backward compatibility
   - Metadata for content identification

3. **Import Process**
   - Password verification
   - Integrity checking
   - Conflict resolution for existing data

    EventBus --> Analytics
    
    Journal -.-> Auth
    Emotion -.-> Auth
    Content -.-> Auth
    Analytics -.-> Auth
    Notification -.-> Auth
```

#### Service Discovery Mechanisms

Amira Wellness implements a service registry pattern for dynamic service discovery:

| Mechanism | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Service Registry | Centralized service catalog | AWS Cloud Map |
| Health Checks | Service availability monitoring | Regular HTTP health endpoints |
| DNS-Based Discovery | Service location resolution | Route 53 service endpoints |
| Configuration Service | Dynamic configuration management | AWS AppConfig |

#### Load Balancing Strategy

    participant Service A
    participant Service B
    participant Fallback
    
    Client->>Service A: Request
    Service A->>Service B: Dependent request
    
    alt Successful Response
        Service B->>Service A: Response data
        Service A->>Client: Complete response
    else Timeout/Error
        Service B--xService A: Timeout/Error
        Service A->>Service A: Circuit breaker trips
        Service A->>Fallback: Request fallback data
        Fallback->>Service A: Fallback response
        Service A->>Client: Degraded response
    end
```

### SCALABILITY DESIGN

#### Horizontal/Vertical Scaling Approach

Amira Wellness employs a hybrid scaling strategy optimized for different service requirements:

| Service | Primary Scaling | Secondary Scaling | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Authentication Service | Horizontal | - | Stateless design enables easy horizontal scaling |
| Journal Service | Horizontal | Vertical | Storage-intensive operations benefit from both approaches |
| Emotion Service | Horizontal | - | Computation can be distributed across instances |
| Content Service | Horizontal | - | Read-heavy workload ideal for horizontal scaling |
| Analytics Service | Vertical | Horizontal | Computation-intensive tasks benefit from larger instances |
| Notification Service | Horizontal | - | Event-driven design scales horizontally |

#### Auto-Scaling Triggers and Rules

The system implements dynamic scaling based on multiple metrics:

| Metric | Threshold | Scaling Action | Cool-down Period |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| CPU Utilization | >70% for 3 minutes | Add 1 instance | 5 minutes |
| Memory Utilization | >75% for 3 minutes | Add 1 instance | 5 minutes |
| Request Rate | >1000 req/min for 2 minutes | Add 2 instances | 3 minutes |
| Response Time | >500ms for 5 minutes | Add 1 instance | 5 minutes |
| Queue Depth | >5000 messages for 2 minutes | Add 2 instances | 3 minutes |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Monitor[Monitoring System] --> Metrics[Collect Metrics]
    Metrics --> Evaluate[Evaluate Scaling Rules]
    
    Evaluate --> CPU{CPU > 70%?}
    Evaluate --> Memory{Memory > 75%?}
    Evaluate --> Requests{Requests > 1000/min?}
    
    CPU -->|Yes| ScaleOut1[Scale Out +1]
    Memory -->|Yes| ScaleOut1
    Requests -->|Yes| ScaleOut2[Scale Out +2]

    ScaleOut2 --> Cooldown2[3min Cooldown]
    
    Cooldown1 --> Monitor
    Cooldown2 --> Monitor
    
    CPU -->|No| ScaleIn{All metrics below threshold?}
    Memory -->|No| ScaleIn
    Requests -->|No| ScaleIn
    
    ScaleIn -->|Yes for 10min| ScaleIn1[Scale In -1]
    ScaleIn1 --> Cooldown3[10min Cooldown]
    Cooldown3 --> Monitor
    
    ScaleIn -->|No| Monitor
```

#### Resource Allocation Strategy

Resources are allocated based on service requirements and usage patterns:

| Service | CPU Allocation | Memory Allocation | Storage Allocation |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Authentication Service | 0.5-2 vCPU | 1-2 GB | 10 GB SSD |
| Journal Service | 1-4 vCPU | 2-8 GB | 500 GB SSD + S3 |
| Emotion Service | 1-4 vCPU | 2-4 GB | 100 GB SSD |
| Content Service | 1-2 vCPU | 2-4 GB | 200 GB SSD + CDN |
| Analytics Service | 2-8 vCPU | 4-16 GB | 200 GB SSD |
| Notification Service | 0.5-2 vCPU | 1-2 GB | 50 GB SSD |

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

The system implements multiple optimization strategies:

| Technique | Application | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Caching | Frequently accessed data | Redis with tiered expiration policies |
| Content Delivery | Static assets | CloudFront CDN with edge caching |
| Database Optimization | Query performance | Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling |
| Asynchronous Processing | Non-critical operations | Background workers with message queues |
| Data Compression | Network transfer | gzip for HTTP, custom compression for audio |

#### Capacity Planning Guidelines

Capacity planning follows these guidelines to ensure adequate resources:

| Metric | Planning Factor | Growth Accommodation |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| User Base | 10,000 initial users, 100% growth per quarter | Pre-provision for 3 months of growth |
| Storage | 5MB average per user for recordings | Auto-scaling storage with 30% buffer |
| Request Rate | 50 requests per DAU per day | Scale to handle 3x peak traffic |
| Concurrent Users | 10% of DAU during peak hours | Provision for 2x peak concurrency |

### RESILIENCE PATTERNS

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

The system implements multiple layers of fault tolerance:

| Mechanism | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Service Redundancy | Eliminate single points of failure | Multiple service instances across availability zones |
| Data Replication | Ensure data availability | Multi-AZ database deployment with read replicas |
| Graceful Degradation | Maintain core functionality | Feature toggles, fallback responses |
| Request Throttling | Protect services during high load | Rate limiting at API Gateway and service levels |

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

The disaster recovery strategy ensures business continuity:

| Scenario | Recovery Approach | RTO | RPO |
|----------|-------------------|-----|-----|
| Service Failure | Automatic failover to healthy instances | < 1 minute | 0 (no data loss) |
| Availability Zone Failure | Cross-AZ redundancy | < 5 minutes | < 1 minute |
| Region Failure | Cross-region backup deployment | < 1 hour | < 15 minutes |
| Data Corruption | Point-in-time recovery | < 2 hours | < 5 minutes |

    Failover -->|Region Failure| ActivateDR[Activate DR Region]
    
    ActivateAZ2 --> RouteTraffic1[Route Traffic to AZ2]
    ActivateDR --> RouteTraffic2[Route Traffic to DR]
```

#### Data Redundancy Approach

Data redundancy is implemented at multiple levels:

| Data Type | Primary Storage | Redundancy Mechanism | Recovery Method |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| User Data | PostgreSQL | Multi-AZ deployment, daily backups | Point-in-time recovery |
| Audio Recordings | S3 | Cross-region replication, versioning | Restore from replicated storage |
| Emotional Data | TimescaleDB | Continuous archiving, replication | WAL replay, standby activation |
| Application Content | MongoDB | Replica sets, backups | Replica promotion, restore from backup |

#### Failover Configurations

Automated failover is configured for critical components:

| Component | Failover Trigger | Failover Target | Verification Method |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Database | Instance health check failure | Read replica promotion | Data consistency check |
| Service Instances | Health check failure | New instance in different AZ | Endpoint availability test |
| API Gateway | Regional endpoint failure | Secondary regional endpoint | Request success rate |
| Cache | Primary node failure | Replica promotion | Cache hit rate monitoring |

#### Service Degradation Policies

The system implements graceful degradation when resources are constrained:

| Condition | Degradation Policy | User Impact | Recovery Trigger |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| High CPU Load | Disable non-critical features | Limited analytics, delayed sync | CPU < 70% for 5 minutes |
| Database Overload | Read-only mode for non-critical writes | Delayed updates, cached responses | DB load < 70% for 5 minutes |
| Network Congestion | Reduce media quality, increase caching | Lower audio quality, older content | Network latency < 100ms |
| Service Unavailability | Offline mode with local functionality | Limited to cached data and tools | Service restoration |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Normal
    
    Normal --> Degraded: Resource constraint detected
    Degraded --> Normal: Resources normalized

        Level2 --> Level3: Condition worsens
        Level3 --> Level2: Condition improves
        Level2 --> Level1: Condition improves
    }
    
    state Level1 {
        DisableAnalytics --> CacheResponses
    }
    
    state Level2 {
        ReadOnlyMode --> ReduceQuality
    }
    
    state Level3 {
        OfflineMode --> EssentialOnly
    }
    
    Degraded --> Emergency: Critical failure
    Emergency --> Degraded: Partial recovery
    Emergency --> Normal: Full recovery
    
    state Emergency {
        MaintenanceMode
    }
```

#### Indexing Strategy

| Table | Index Name | Columns | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|------|---------|
| USERS | idx_users_email | email | BTREE | Fast lookup by email during authentication |
| VOICE_JOURNALS | idx_journals_user_id | user_id | BTREE | Fast retrieval of user's journals |
| VOICE_JOURNALS | idx_journals_created_at | user_id, created_at | BTREE | Chronological journal listing |
| EMOTIONAL_CHECKINS | idx_checkins_user_time | user_id, created_at | BTREE | Time-based emotional data queries |
| EMOTIONAL_CHECKINS | idx_checkins_emotion | user_id, emotion_type_id | BTREE | Emotion-based filtering |
| TOOL_USAGE | idx_tool_usage_user | user_id | BTREE | User's tool usage history |
| USER_ACTIVITIES | idx_activities_user_time | user_id, created_at | BTREE | Chronological activity tracking |
| USER_STREAKS | idx_streaks_user | user_id | BTREE | Fast streak lookup |

#### Partitioning Approach

Time-series data like emotional check-ins and user activities are partitioned by time to improve query performance and facilitate data archiving:

| Table | Partition Type | Partition Key | Partition Interval | Retention Policy |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| EMOTIONAL_CHECKINS | Range | created_at | Monthly | 24 months online, then archived |
| USER_ACTIVITIES | Range | created_at | Monthly | 12 months online, then archived |
| VOICE_JOURNALS | Range | created_at | Quarterly | Indefinite (user-controlled) |

#### Replication Configuration

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PrimaryDB[(Primary Database)] --> ReadReplica1[(Read Replica 1)]
    PrimaryDB --> ReadReplica2[(Read Replica 2)]
    PrimaryDB --> StandbyReplica[(Standby Replica)]
    
    subgraph "Primary Region"
        PrimaryDB
        ReadReplica1
        ReadReplica2
    end
    
    subgraph "Secondary Region"
        StandbyReplica
    end
    
    APIServices[API Services] --> LoadBalancer[Database Load Balancer]
    LoadBalancer -->|Write Operations| PrimaryDB
    LoadBalancer -->|Read Operations| ReadSelector[Read Replica Selector]
    
    ReadSelector --> ReadReplica1
    ReadSelector --> ReadReplica2
    
    MonitoringSystem[Monitoring System] --> PrimaryDB
    MonitoringSystem --> ReadReplica1
    MonitoringSystem --> ReadReplica2
    MonitoringSystem --> StandbyReplica
    
    FailoverController[Failover Controller] --> PrimaryDB
    FailoverController --> StandbyReplica
```

The database replication strategy includes:

1. **Primary-Replica Configuration**: One primary database for write operations with multiple read replicas
2. **Cross-Region Replication**: Standby replica in a secondary region for disaster recovery
3. **Synchronous Replication**: Between primary and standby for zero data loss
4. **Asynchronous Replication**: To read replicas for performance optimization

#### Backup Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PrimaryDB[(Primary Database)] --> DailyBackup[Daily Full Backup]
    PrimaryDB --> ContinuousWAL[Continuous WAL Archiving]
    
    DailyBackup --> S3Backup[(S3 Backup Storage)]
    ContinuousWAL --> S3WAL[(S3 WAL Storage)]
    
    S3Backup --> CrossRegionBackup[(Cross-Region Backup)]
    S3WAL --> CrossRegionWAL[(Cross-Region WAL)]
    
    BackupManager[Backup Manager] --> DailyBackup

    BackupVerification --> TestRestore[Test Restoration]
    
    RetentionPolicy[Retention Policy Manager] --> S3Backup
    RetentionPolicy --> S3WAL
    
    DisasterRecovery[Disaster Recovery System] --> S3Backup
    DisasterRecovery --> S3WAL
    DisasterRecovery --> PrimaryDB
```

The backup strategy includes:

1. **Daily Full Backups**: Complete database snapshots stored in S3
2. **Continuous WAL Archiving**: Transaction logs for point-in-time recovery
3. **Cross-Region Replication**: Backups replicated to secondary region
4. **Automated Verification**: Weekly test restorations to verify backup integrity
5. **Retention Policies**: Tiered retention (daily for 7 days, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year)

### DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

Database migrations follow a structured approach to ensure data integrity and minimal downtime:

1. **Development Phase**
   - Schema changes developed and tested in development environment
   - Migration scripts created with both up and down migrations
   - Data transformation logic tested with production-like data

2. **Testing Phase**
   - Migrations applied to staging environment
   - Performance impact measured
   - Rollback procedures tested

3. **Deployment Phase**
   - Pre-migration validation checks
   - Off-peak execution window
   - Phased approach for large migrations
   - Real-time monitoring during migration

4. **Post-Deployment Phase**
   - Validation of data integrity
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Rollback readiness maintained for 24 hours

#### Versioning Strategy

| Version Component | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| Schema Version | Track database structure changes | Version table with sequential numbering |
| Migration Scripts | Apply incremental changes | Timestamped files with sequential execution |
| Data Version | Track data format changes | Version metadata in affected tables |
| API Version | Maintain compatibility | Version-specific endpoints during transitions |

Database schema changes follow semantic versioning:
- **Major**: Breaking changes requiring client updates
- **Minor**: Backward-compatible additions
- **Patch**: Non-structural changes and optimizations

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archive Retention | Archival Trigger |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Voice Journals | Indefinite (user-controlled) | Indefinite | User deletion request |
| Emotional Check-ins | 24 months | 5 years | Time-based |
| User Activities | 12 months | 3 years | Time-based |
| Tool Usage | 12 months | 3 years | Time-based |
| Authentication Logs | 3 months | 1 year | Time-based |

Archival process:
1. Data is moved to cold storage (S3 Glacier)
2. Archived data is encrypted with user-specific keys
3. Metadata remains in primary database with archive references
4. Restoration process available for legal or user requests

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

| Data Type | Storage Mechanism | Retrieval Pattern | Optimization |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| User Profiles | Relational Database | Direct Query | Caching |
| Voice Recordings | S3 Object Storage | Presigned URLs | CDN for frequent access |
| Emotional Data | Time-Series Database | Aggregation Queries | Materialized Views |
| Tool Content | Document Database | Direct Query + Cache | Content Versioning |
| Activity Logs | Append-Only Log Store | Analytical Queries | Periodic Aggregation |

**Voice Journal Storage Flow**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as API Service
    participant DB as Database
    participant S3 as S3 Storage
    participant CDN as Content Delivery Network
    
    Client->>API: Upload encrypted recording
    API->>S3: Store encrypted audio
    S3->>API: Return storage reference
    API->>DB: Save metadata with reference
    DB->>API: Confirm storage
    API->>Client: Return success
    
    Client->>API: Request recording
    API->>DB: Fetch metadata
    DB->>API: Return metadata with reference
    API->>S3: Generate presigned URL
    S3->>API: Return URL
    API->>Client: Return URL and metadata
    Client->>S3: Fetch encrypted recording
    S3->>Client: Return encrypted data
```

#### Caching Policies

| Cache Type | Data Cached | Invalidation Strategy | TTL |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|-----|
| User Profile | Basic user information | On update, token expiration | 30 minutes |
| Tool Library | Tool content and metadata | On content update | 24 hours |
| Emotional Insights | Calculated trends and patterns | On new check-in, scheduled refresh | 6 hours |
| Authentication | Session tokens, permissions | On logout, password change | 2 hours |
| API Responses | Frequent non-personalized requests | Time-based, version change | 5 minutes |

### COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

#### Data Retention Rules

| Data Category | Retention Period | Justification | Deletion Method |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Account Information | Account lifetime + 30 days | User identification | Soft delete, then anonymization |
| Voice Recordings | User-controlled | Personal content ownership | Immediate deletion with verification |
| Emotional Data | 24 months active, 5 years archived | Pattern analysis, legal compliance | Aggregation after archive period |
| Authentication Logs | 3 months active, 1 year archived | Security monitoring, fraud detection | Complete deletion after archive |
| Usage Analytics | 12 months with identifiers, indefinite when anonymized | Product improvement | Anonymization after 12 months |

#### Backup and Fault Tolerance Policies

| Component | Backup Frequency | Retention | Recovery Time Objective | Recovery Point Objective |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Primary Database | Daily full, continuous WAL | 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly | 1 hour | < 5 minutes |
| User Content (S3) | Continuous replication | Indefinite (user-controlled) | 30 minutes | < 1 minute |
| Configuration Data | On change + daily | 90 days | 15 minutes | < 15 minutes |
| Application Code | On deployment | All versions for 1 year | 30 minutes | Last successful deployment |

Fault tolerance measures:
1. Multi-AZ database deployment with automatic failover
2. Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
3. Read replicas for load distribution and failover
4. Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
5. Data corruption detection with checksums and verification

#### Privacy Controls

| Privacy Measure | Implementation | User Control |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Data Encryption | End-to-end encryption for voice recordings | User holds encryption keys |
| Data Access | Role-based access control with least privilege | Access logs available to users |
| Data Portability | Export functionality for all user data | Self-service export in settings |
| Right to be Forgotten | Complete account deletion process | Self-service with verification |
| Consent Management | Granular permissions for data usage | Revocable through settings |

**Privacy-Focused Data Flow**:

    DataMinimization --> DataDelivery[Data Delivery]
```

#### Audit Mechanisms

| Audit Type | Events Captured | Retention | Access Control |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Authentication | Login attempts, password changes, token issuance | 1 year | Security team only |
| Data Access | Record views, exports, modifications | 6 months | User + Security team |
| Administrative | Schema changes, permission changes, user management | 2 years | Database administrators |
| Security | Encryption operations, key management, security settings | 2 years | Security team only |

Audit implementation:
1. Immutable audit logs stored separately from application data
2. Cryptographic verification of log integrity
3. Automated monitoring for suspicious patterns
4. Regular compliance reviews of audit trails

#### Access Controls

| Access Level | Permissions | Authentication Requirements | Example Roles |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| User | Access own data, create/modify own content | Standard authentication | Regular app users |
| Content Manager | Manage tool library content | MFA + IP restriction | Content creators, editors |
| Support | View limited user data, assist with issues | MFA + IP restriction | Customer support |
| Administrator | System configuration, user management | MFA + IP restriction + approval | System administrators |
| Data Analyst | Anonymized data access for analytics | MFA + IP restriction + approval | Data scientists |

Access control implementation:
1. Role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege
2. Attribute-based restrictions (time, location, device)
3. Just-in-time access for administrative functions
4. Segregation of duties for sensitive operations
5. Regular access reviews and certification

### PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

| Pattern | Application | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Selective Indexing | Frequently filtered columns | Composite indexes for common query patterns |
| Materialized Views | Emotional trend analysis | Precalculated aggregations refreshed on schedule |
| Query Rewriting | Complex analytical queries | Stored procedures with optimized execution plans |
| Data Denormalization | Frequently joined data | Redundant storage with consistency mechanisms |
| Pagination | Large result sets | Keyset pagination with cursor-based approach |

Key optimization techniques:
1. Query plan analysis and tuning for frequent operations
2. Proper use of database-specific features (e.g., PostgreSQL JSONB for flexible data)
3. Avoiding N+1 query problems through eager loading
4. Strategic use of database functions for complex operations
5. Regular database statistics updates for query optimizer

#### Caching Strategy

```mermaid

    CacheStorage --> CacheTTL[Set TTL Based on Type]
    CacheTTL --> ReturnResponse[Return Response]
    SkipCache --> ReturnResponse
    CacheResponse --> ReturnResponse
    
    subgraph "Cache Layers"
        L1[Application Memory]
        L2[Distributed Cache]
        L3[Database Result Cache]
    end
    
    CacheCheck --> L1
    L1 -->|Miss| L2
    L2 -->|Miss| L3
    
    CacheStorage --> CacheType{Cache Type?}
    CacheType -->|Transient| L1

    InvalidationEvents[Invalidation Events] --> CacheInvalidator[Cache Invalidator]
    CacheInvalidator --> L1
    CacheInvalidator --> L2
    CacheInvalidator --> L3
```

Multi-level caching strategy:
1. **L1: Application Memory Cache**
   - Scope: Instance-local, short-lived data
   - Implementation: In-memory cache with LRU eviction
   - TTL: Very short (seconds to minutes)

2. **L2: Distributed Cache**
   - Scope: Cross-instance, frequently accessed data
   - Implementation: Redis with data structures
   - TTL: Medium (minutes to hours)

3. **L3: Database Result Cache**
   - Scope: Query results, aggregations
   - Implementation: PostgreSQL result cache or materialized views
   - TTL: Longer (hours to days)

#### Connection Pooling

| Environment | Min Connections | Max Connections | Idle Timeout | Max Lifetime |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| API Services | 5 | 20 | 10 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Background Workers | 2 | 10 | 15 minutes | 1 hour |
| Analytics Services | 2 | 5 | 5 minutes | 30 minutes |

Connection pool management:
1. Separate pools for read and write operations
2. Health checking with automatic removal of bad connections
3. Metrics collection for pool utilization and wait times
4. Adaptive sizing based on load patterns
5. Connection validation before use

#### Read/Write Splitting

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client Request] --> RequestAnalyzer[Request Analyzer]
    
    RequestAnalyzer -->|Write Operation| PrimaryDB[(Primary Database)]
    RequestAnalyzer -->|Read Operation| ReadRouter[Read Router]
    
    ReadRouter -->|User Profile| UserProfileCache[User Profile Cache]
    ReadRouter -->|Content Data| ContentCache[Content Cache]
    ReadRouter -->|Analytics| AnalyticsDB[(Analytics Database)]
    ReadRouter -->|Standard Read| ReadBalancer[Read Replica Balancer]
    
    ReadBalancer --> ReadReplica1[(Read Replica 1)]
    ReadBalancer --> ReadReplica2[(Read Replica 2)]

    ContentCache -->|Miss| ReadBalancer
    
    PrimaryDB -->|Replication| ReadReplica1
    PrimaryDB -->|Replication| ReadReplica2
    PrimaryDB -->|ETL| AnalyticsDB
```

Read/write splitting implementation:
1. Automatic routing based on query type detection
2. Sticky sessions for transaction consistency
3. Replica lag monitoring with fallback to primary
4. Load balancing across read replicas
5. Specialized replicas for analytical queries

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Process Type | Batch Size | Frequency | Priority |
|--------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Emotional Trend Analysis | 1000 records | Hourly | Low |
| User Activity Aggregation | 5000 records | Daily | Medium |
| Recommendation Generation | 100 users | Daily | Medium |
| Data Archiving | 10000 records | Weekly | Low |

Batch processing implementation:
1. Background worker services with queue-based processing
2. Idempotent operations with checkpoint tracking
3. Parallel processing with configurable concurrency
4. Error handling with retry mechanisms
5. Resource throttling to prevent database overload

```

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

The Amira Wellness application requires integration with several external systems to provide its core functionality while maintaining the privacy-first approach. This section outlines the integration architecture that enables secure communication between the mobile application and backend services, as well as with third-party systems.

### API DESIGN

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| HTTPS | All API communications | Ensures encrypted data transmission for all client-server interactions |
| REST | Primary API architecture | Provides stateless, cacheable communication with clear resource definitions |
| WebSockets | Real-time notifications | Enables push notifications and real-time updates for emotional insights |

All API endpoints follow a resource-oriented design with standard HTTP methods:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Mobile Client] -->|HTTPS| Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway -->|REST| Auth[Authentication API]
    Gateway -->|REST| Journal[Journal API]
    Gateway -->|REST| Emotion[Emotion API]
    Gateway -->|REST| Tool[Tool Library API]
    Gateway -->|REST| Progress[Progress API]
    Gateway -->|WebSockets| Notification[Notification Service]
```

#### Authentication Methods

| Method | Application | Security Considerations |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| JWT | Primary authentication | Short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation |
| OAuth 2.0 | Future social login | Delegated authorization with scope limitations |
| API Keys | Service-to-service | Limited to internal services with IP restrictions |

The authentication flow implements a secure token-based approach:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as Mobile App
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant Service as API Service
    
    User->>Client: Login credentials
    Client->>Gateway: Authentication request
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate credentials
    Auth->>Gateway: Issue JWT tokens (access + refresh)
    Gateway->>Client: Return tokens
    
    Client->>Gateway: API request with access token
    Gateway->>Gateway: Validate token
    Gateway->>Service: Forward authenticated request
    Service->>Gateway: Response
    Gateway->>Client: Return response
    
    Note over Client,Auth: When access token expires
    Client->>Gateway: Request with expired token
    Gateway->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
    Client->>Gateway: Request new token with refresh token
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate refresh token
    Auth->>Gateway: Issue new access token
    Gateway->>Client: Return new access token
```

#### Authorization Framework

The authorization model uses role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions:

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| User | Standard application user | Access to own data only |
| Premium | Paid subscription user | Access to premium features |
| Content Manager | Tool library administrator | Manage tool content |
| Administrator | System administrator | Full system access |

Authorization is enforced at multiple levels:

1. API Gateway level for coarse-grained access control
2. Service level for fine-grained permission checks
3. Database level for row-level security

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| Client Type | Rate Limit | Burst Allowance | Throttling Response |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mobile App | 100 req/min | 150 req/min | 429 Too Many Requests |
| Admin Portal | 300 req/min | 450 req/min | 429 Too Many Requests |
| Service-to-Service | 1000 req/min | 1500 req/min | 429 Too Many Requests |

Rate limiting is implemented using a token bucket algorithm with:

1. Per-user limits to prevent individual abuse
2. Per-IP limits to prevent distributed attacks
3. Endpoint-specific limits for sensitive operations
4. Graduated response with warning headers before throttling

#### Versioning Approach

API versioning follows a URL-based approach for clear client compatibility:

```
https://api.amirawellness.com/v1/journals
https://api.amirawellness.com/v2/journals
```

| Version | Status | Support Timeline | Migration Path |
|---------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| v1 | Current | Minimum 12 months | Documentation provided |
| v2 | Planning | Future release | Compatibility layer available |

Versioning principles:
1. Non-breaking changes are made within versions
2. Breaking changes require a new version
3. Deprecation notices are provided 3 months before end-of-life
4. Multiple versions are supported simultaneously during transition periods

#### Documentation Standards

API documentation follows the OpenAPI 3.0 specification with:

1. Complete endpoint descriptions with request/response schemas
2. Authentication and authorization requirements
3. Error codes and handling recommendations
4. Rate limiting information
5. Example requests and responses
6. SDK code samples for iOS and Android

Documentation is automatically generated from code annotations and maintained as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure accuracy.

### MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

The system implements an event-driven architecture for asynchronous operations:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Event Sources"
        UserActivity[User Activity Events]
        SystemEvents[System Events]
        ScheduledEvents[Scheduled Events]

    subgraph "Event Bus"
        EventRouter[Event Router]
    end
    
    subgraph "Event Consumers"
        AnalyticsProcessor[Analytics Processor]
        NotificationService[Notification Service]
        RecommendationEngine[Recommendation Engine]
        AuditLogger[Audit Logger]
    end
    
    UserActivity -->|Publish| EventRouter
    SystemEvents -->|Publish| EventRouter
    ScheduledEvents -->|Publish| EventRouter
    
    EventRouter -->|Subscribe| AnalyticsProcessor
    EventRouter -->|Subscribe| NotificationService
    EventRouter -->|Subscribe| RecommendationEngine
    EventRouter -->|Subscribe| AuditLogger
```

Key event types include:

| Event Category | Examples | Processing Priority |
|----------------|----------|---------------------|
| User Activity | Journal created, Emotional check-in | High |
| System Events | Service health, Error conditions | Medium |
| Scheduled Events | Daily summaries, Streak calculations | Low |

#### Message Queue Architecture

The message processing system uses a reliable message queue architecture:

```mermaid

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    EmotionalData[Emotional Data Stream] --> Processor[Stream Processor]
    
    Processor --> Filter[Filtering]
    Filter --> Transform[Transformation]
    Transform --> Aggregate[Aggregation]
    Aggregate --> PatternDetection[Pattern Detection]
    
    PatternDetection --> InsightStore[Insight Store]
    PatternDetection --> AlertGenerator[Alert Generator]
    
    AlertGenerator --> NotificationService[Notification Service]
    InsightStore --> VisualizationAPI[Visualization API]
```

Stream processing capabilities:
1. Real-time emotional trend analysis
2. Pattern detection for emotional shifts
3. Anomaly detection for potential interventions
4. Windowed aggregations for time-based insights

#### Batch Processing Flows

For computationally intensive operations, the system uses scheduled batch processing:

    Error[Error Occurs] --> Classify[Classify Error]
    
    Classify --> Transient[Transient Error]
    Classify --> Permanent[Permanent Error]
    Classify --> BusinessRule[Business Rule Violation]
    
    Transient --> RetryPolicy[Apply Retry Policy]
    RetryPolicy --> RetrySuccess{Success?}
    RetrySuccess -->|Yes| Continue[Continue Processing]
    RetrySuccess -->|No| DeadLetter[Move to Dead Letter]
    
    Permanent --> Log[Log Error Details]
    Log --> Alert[Generate Alert]
    Log --> DeadLetter
    
    BusinessRule --> UserNotification[Notify User]
    BusinessRule --> Log
    
    DeadLetter --> ErrorQueue[Error Queue]
    ErrorQueue --> ErrorDashboard[Error Dashboard]
    ErrorQueue --> ManualIntervention[Manual Intervention]
    ErrorQueue --> AutomaticRecovery[Automatic Recovery]
```

Error handling principles:
1. Detailed error logging with context for troubleshooting
2. Categorization of errors for appropriate handling
3. Retry policies with exponential backoff for transient failures
4. Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
5. User-friendly error messages for client-facing issues

    MobileApp->>KeyManagement: Request decryption key
    KeyManagement->>MobileApp: Provide key
    MobileApp->>MobileApp: Decrypt data locally
    MobileApp->>User: Play decrypted audio
```

This end-to-end encryption approach ensures that sensitive user data, particularly voice recordings, remains encrypted throughout the entire process and can only be decrypted on the user's device.

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

The Amira Wellness application implements a comprehensive authentication framework to ensure user identity protection while maintaining a seamless user experience. Privacy and security are core principles, especially given the sensitive nature of emotional wellness data.

#### Identity Management

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| User Registration | Email verification flow | Verify user identity and prevent account abuse |
| Account Recovery | Secure password reset with verification | Allow legitimate account recovery while preventing takeover |
| Identity Providers | Native authentication, future OAuth support | Support multiple authentication methods |
| Device Registration | Unique device identifiers with verification | Track authorized devices for security monitoring |

The identity management system maintains a clear separation between authentication data and emotional wellness data, with the latter receiving additional encryption protections.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Login Attempt] --> B{Primary Authentication}
    B -->|Success| C{Risk Assessment}
    B -->|Failure| D[Login Failed]
    
    C -->|Low Risk| E[Login Successful]
    C -->|Medium Risk| F{MFA Required?}
    C -->|High Risk| G[Require MFA]
    
    F -->|Yes| G
    F -->|No| E
    
    G --> H{MFA Method}
    H -->|Email Code| I[Send Email Code]
    H -->|SMS Code| J[Send SMS Code]
    H -->|Authenticator App| K[Request App Code]
    
    I --> L{Verify Code}
    J --> L
    K --> L
    
    L -->|Valid| E
    L -->|Invalid| M[MFA Failed]
    M --> N[Retry or Alternative]
```

MFA implementation details:
- Optional for standard access, mandatory for sensitive operations
- Supports email verification codes initially
- Future support for authenticator apps
- Adaptive MFA based on risk assessment (unusual location, new device)
- Fallback mechanisms for account recovery

#### Session Management

| Session Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-------------------|-------|---------------|
| Session Duration | 14 days | Balance between security and user convenience |
| Idle Timeout | 30 minutes | Protect against unauthorized access on unattended devices |
| Concurrent Sessions | Limited to 5 | Prevent credential sharing while allowing legitimate multi-device use |
| Session Validation | Server-side with client verification | Prevent session hijacking |

The session management system implements:
- Secure session storage on mobile devices using platform security features
- Automatic session termination on password change
- Ability for users to view and terminate active sessions
- Session continuity across app updates

#### Token Handling

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as Mobile App
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant API as API Services
    
    User->>Client: Login
    Client->>Auth: Authenticate
    Auth->>Client: Issue Access & Refresh Tokens
    
    Note over Client,API: Normal API Usage
    Client->>API: Request with Access Token
    API->>Client: Response
    
    Note over Client,Auth: Token Refresh Flow
    Client->>Auth: Refresh with Refresh Token
    Auth->>Client: New Access & Refresh Tokens
    
    Note over Client,Auth: Token Revocation
    User->>Client: Logout
    Client->>Auth: Revoke Tokens
    Auth->>Client: Tokens Invalidated
    Client->>Client: Clear Local Tokens
```

Token implementation details:
- JWT-based access tokens with short lifespan (15 minutes)
- Secure refresh tokens with longer lifespan (14 days)
- Refresh token rotation on each use
- Token revocation on logout or security events
- Secure storage using platform keychain/keystore

#### Password Policies

| Policy | Requirement | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Minimum Length | 10 characters | Client and server validation |
| Complexity | Mix of character types | Visual strength meter with requirements |
| Common Passwords | Prohibited | Server-side check against known weak passwords |
| Password History | No reuse of last 5 passwords | Server-side validation on password change |
| Reset Frequency | Optional, recommended every 6 months | Gentle reminders without forced resets |

Additional password security measures:
- Argon2id for password hashing with appropriate work factors
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts with progressive delays
- Password strength estimation during creation

### AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

#### Role-Based Access Control

The application implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system with clearly defined roles and permissions:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "User Roles"
        A[Standard User]
        B[Premium User]
        C[Content Manager]
        D[System Administrator]
    end
    
    subgraph "Permission Sets"
        E[Basic Access]
        F[Premium Features]
        G[Content Management]
        H[User Management]
        I[System Configuration]
    end
    
    A -->|Has| E
    B -->|Has| E
    B -->|Has| F
    C -->|Has| E
    C -->|Has| G
    D -->|Has| E
    D -->|Has| H
    D -->|Has| I
    
    subgraph "Resources"
        J[Own User Data]
        K[Premium Content]
        L[Tool Library]
        M[User Accounts]
        N[System Settings]
    end
    
    E -->|Access| J
    F -->|Access| K
    G -->|Manage| L
    H -->|Manage| M
    I -->|Configure| N
```

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Standard User | Regular application user | Access own data, use basic features |
| Premium User | Paid subscription user | Standard permissions plus premium features |
| Content Manager | Tool library administrator | Manage tool content and categories |
| System Administrator | Technical administrator | Full system access and configuration |

#### Permission Management

The permission system follows these principles:
- Least privilege by default
- Granular permissions for specific actions
- Hierarchical permission inheritance
- Dynamic permission evaluation based on context
- Regular permission audits and reviews

Permission assignments are stored in a dedicated database table with:
- Role-permission mappings
- User-role assignments
- Direct user-permission assignments for exceptions
- Temporal permissions with expiration dates

#### Resource Authorization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Authorization Service
    participant Resource as Resource Service
    
    Client->>Gateway: Request Resource
    Gateway->>Auth: Authorize Request
    
    Auth->>Auth: Validate Token
    Auth->>Auth: Extract User Context
    Auth->>Auth: Evaluate Policies
    
    alt Authorized
        Auth->>Gateway: Authorization Granted
        Gateway->>Resource: Forward Request
        Resource->>Resource: Apply Resource Filters
        Resource->>Gateway: Return Filtered Resource
        Gateway->>Client: Resource Response
    else Unauthorized
        Auth->>Gateway: Authorization Denied
        Gateway->>Client: 403 Forbidden
    end
```

Resource authorization is implemented at multiple levels:
1. **API Gateway**: Coarse-grained authorization based on role
2. **Service Layer**: Fine-grained authorization based on permissions
3. **Data Layer**: Row-level security for data access control
4. **Client**: UI element visibility based on permissions

#### Policy Enforcement Points

| Enforcement Point | Responsibility | Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| API Gateway | Request validation, authentication verification | AWS API Gateway with custom authorizers |
| Service Controllers | Business logic authorization | Permission checks before operations |
| Data Access Layer | Data filtering and access control | Row-level security policies |
| Mobile Application | UI rendering based on permissions | Component visibility rules |

The policy enforcement architecture follows a defense-in-depth approach with multiple validation layers to prevent authorization bypasses.

#### Audit Logging

All security-relevant events are logged with the following information:
- Timestamp with millisecond precision
- User identifier and session identifier
- Action performed or attempted
- Resource affected
- Success/failure status
- Source IP and device information
- Geographic location when available

Security audit logs are:
- Stored separately from application logs
- Protected with strict access controls
- Retained for a minimum of 1 year
- Regularly reviewed for suspicious patterns
- Immutable to prevent tampering

### DATA PROTECTION

#### Encryption Standards

| Data Category | Encryption Standard | Implementation |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Voice Recordings | AES-256-GCM | End-to-end encryption with user-controlled keys |
| Emotional Data | AES-256-CBC | Encrypted at rest with application keys |
| User Credentials | Argon2id | Password hashing with appropriate work factors |
| Communications | TLS 1.3 | Secure transport for all API communications |

The encryption implementation follows these principles:
- Modern, widely-reviewed encryption algorithms
- Appropriate key lengths for long-term security
- Perfect forward secrecy for communications
- Regular cryptographic library updates
- Deprecation plan for algorithms approaching end-of-life

    end
    
    subgraph "Secure Storage"
        E[Hardware Security Module]
        F[Secure Enclave/Keystore]
    end
    
    subgraph "Server Infrastructure"
        G[AWS KMS]
        H[Application Keys]
        I[Database Encryption]
    end
    
    C -.->|Protected by| F
    D -->|Encrypts| J[User Content]
    
    G -->|Manages| H
    H -->|Secures| I
    
    K[Key Rotation System] -->|Rotates| D
    K -->|Rotates| H
    
    L[Backup System] -->|Secures| M[Key Backups]
    M -.->|Protected by| E
```

Key management practices include:
- Separation of encryption keys by purpose and sensitivity
- Hardware-backed key storage where available
- Key derivation from user credentials for end-to-end encryption
- Regular key rotation for application keys
- Secure key backup and recovery procedures
- Key access audit logging

#### Data Masking Rules

| Data Type | Masking Rule | Application |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|

```

The security architecture implements a defense-in-depth approach with clearly defined security zones and boundaries:

1. **Public Zone**: End-user devices and public internet
2. **DMZ**: Edge services that handle public traffic
3. **Application Zone**: Core application services with business logic
4. **Data Zone**: Data storage with strict access controls
5. **Management Zone**: Administrative functions with privileged access

Traffic between zones is controlled by:
- Network segmentation with security groups
- Explicit allow-list traffic rules
- Service-to-service authentication
- Encryption of all cross-zone traffic
- Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection

**Test Data Principles**:

1. No real user data in test environments
2. Synthetic data generation for emotional patterns
3. Parameterized tests for edge cases
4. Isolated test data for concurrent test execution
5. Automated cleanup after test completion

### SECURITY TESTING

Given the sensitive nature of emotional wellness data, security testing is a critical component of the testing strategy.

### 8. Responsive Design Considerations

The UI will adapt to different screen sizes with the following considerations:

1. **Small Screens (iPhone SE, etc.)**
   - Simplified layouts with essential information
   - Vertical scrolling for longer content
   - Reduced padding and margins

2. **Medium Screens (Standard smartphones)**
   - Standard layouts as shown in wireframes
   - Balanced white space and content

3. **Large Screens (Tablets, large phones)**
   - Two-column layouts where appropriate
   - Larger touch targets
   - Enhanced visualizations for progress tracking
