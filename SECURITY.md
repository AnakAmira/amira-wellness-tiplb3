## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Amira Wellness team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and users in identifying and responsibly disclosing potential issues.

### Reporting Process

To report a security vulnerability, please email security@amirawellness.com with a detailed description of the issue. Include steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any supporting materials such as screenshots or proof-of-concept code.

We request that you encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP key](https://amirawellness.com/security/pgp-key.txt).

### Response Timeline

- Initial acknowledgment: Within 48 hours
- Assessment and validation: Within 7 days
- Remediation plan: Within 14 days of validation
- Public disclosure: Coordinated with the reporter after the vulnerability has been addressed

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. We request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had an opportunity to address it. We commit to keeping you informed about our progress and will work with you on the timing and details of any public disclosure.

## Security Measures

Amira Wellness implements the following security measures to protect user data:

### End-to-End Encryption

Voice recordings and sensitive emotional data are encrypted end-to-end using AES-256-GCM, ensuring that only the user can access their data. Encryption keys are derived from user credentials using the Argon2id key derivation function and are never transmitted to our servers. This means that even in the event of a server breach, your emotional wellness data remains protected.

Technical implementation details:
- Client-side encryption of all voice recordings before transmission
- Unique initialization vectors (IVs) for each encrypted item
- Secure key storage using platform-specific security features (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- Encrypted metadata to prevent pattern analysis

### Authentication

We use industry-standard authentication mechanisms with JWT tokens, secure password storage using Argon2id, and optional biometric authentication. Our authentication system includes:

- Secure password policies requiring strong passwords
- Protection against brute force attacks through rate limiting
- Multi-factor authentication options
- Session management with automatic timeout for inactivity
- Regular access token rotation

### Data Protection

All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Voice recordings are stored in encrypted form with user-controlled keys. Our data protection measures include:

- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Server-side encryption for databases using AES-256
- Minimal data collection following privacy-by-design principles
- Secure data deletion when requested by users
- Regular backup testing and validation

### Regular Security Audits

We conduct regular security assessments and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities:

- Automated static application security testing (SAST) during development
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST) in staging environments
- Regular penetration testing by third-party security firms
- Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities

### Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update third-party dependencies to address known vulnerabilities:

- Automated dependency scanning in our CI/CD pipeline
- Vendor security assessment for critical dependencies
- Minimal use of third-party libraries to reduce attack surface
- Verification of library signatures and integrity

## Security Compliance

Amira Wellness is designed to comply with relevant data protection regulations, including GDPR. We implement privacy by design principles throughout our development process:

- Data minimization: We collect only what is necessary
- Purpose limitation: Data is used only for its intended purpose
- Storage limitation: Data is kept only as long as needed
- User rights: Easy access to download or delete personal data
- Transparent processing: Clear information about how data is used

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we do recognize and acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Researchers who report valid security issues will be credited (with permission) in our security acknowledgments page.

## Security Updates

Security updates are delivered through regular application updates. Users will be notified of critical security updates through in-app notifications. We follow these practices for security updates:

- Critical vulnerabilities are patched and released as soon as possible
- Regular security updates are bundled with feature releases
- Clear communication about security implications in release notes
- Automatic update prompts for security-critical updates
