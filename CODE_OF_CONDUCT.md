# Amira Wellness Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Amira Wellness is committed to building a safe, supportive, and inclusive community that reflects our mission of providing accessible emotional wellness tools. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all contributors, users, and community members to help us create a safe and positive experience for everyone. This is especially important given the sensitive nature of emotional wellbeing data and the diverse Spanish-speaking communities we serve.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to prioritize the privacy, security, and emotional wellbeing of our users and community members in all our actions and decisions. We recognize the deeply personal nature of emotional wellness journeys and commit to creating spaces where people feel safe to express themselves.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language that respects cultural and linguistic diversity
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and our users
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Prioritizing user privacy and data security in all contributions
* Being mindful of the emotional impact of communications and decisions
* Respecting the personal nature of emotional wellness journeys

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Compromising or disregarding user privacy or data security
* Dismissing or belittling emotional experiences or mental health concerns
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Using community platforms to gather data without transparent consent

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers are particularly responsible for enforcing standards related to privacy and security, given the sensitive nature of emotional wellness data. This includes ensuring that all contributions adhere to our privacy-first approach and that community discussions respect the confidential nature of personal emotional experiences.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

The Code of Conduct is especially important when handling or discussing topics related to user data, emotional experiences, or personal wellness journeys. We expect all community members to maintain the highest standards of privacy and respect when engaging with such sensitive information.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@amirawellness.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Privacy and confidentiality will be maintained throughout the reporting and enforcement process, reflecting our overall commitment to privacy in all aspects of the Amira Wellness project.

The enforcement process is as follows:

1. **Report Submission**: Submit a report via email with as much detail as possible
2. **Acknowledgment**: The team will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
3. **Investigation**: A thorough investigation will take place with appropriate discretion
4. **Resolution Determination**: The team will determine appropriate actions based on the investigation
5. **Communication**: The reporting party will be informed of the resolution (while respecting privacy considerations)
6. **Implementation**: Any necessary actions will be implemented

Enforcement actions may include:

* A request for modification of behavior
* A private warning
* Temporary or permanent ban from some or all community spaces
* Removal of contributions
* Public statement of violation (in severe cases and with privacy considerations)
